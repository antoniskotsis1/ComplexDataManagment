# Fist Project
## Implementation of operators
* join
* union
* intersection
* set difference
* group by

## Join
Implemented by the classic merge join algorithm.
### Input: 
R_sorted.tsv or S_sorted.tsv
Tab seperated values sortded by ascending orded. Formation (str, int)

## Union, Intersection, Set-difference
These operators were implemented by alteration on the merge-join algorithm
### Input: 
R_sorted.tsv or S_sorted.tsv
Tab seperated values sortded by ascending orded. Formation (str, int)

## GroupBy
Implemented by the recursive merge-sort algorithm
### Input: 
R.tsv 
Tab seperated values unsortded. Formation (str, int)
